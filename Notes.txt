; If you have CUE (Corsair Utility Engine) open, and your keyboard selected 
; (in all its RGB glory), it will take a lot longer to switch between applications. 
; to fix this lag, simply close CUE, or select some other "demo" peripheral.

; For some of the firefox/chrome shortcuts, you have to install the ACC library into AutoHotKey (it's pretty easy, just follow the instructions on this page.)

; KEYS                  PREMIERE FUNCTIONS
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; ctrl alt s            select clip at playhead. Probably this should be moved to a different series of keystrokes, so that "u" is freed for something else.
; backspace             ripple delete --- but I don't use that in AutoHotKey because it's dangerous. This should be changed to something else; I use SHIFT C now.
; shift c               ripple delete --- very convenient for left handed use. Premiere's poor track targeting makes ripple delete less useful than it could be.
; ctrl alt shift d      ripple delete --- I never type this in manually - long shortcuts like this are great for using AHK or a macro to press them.
; delete                delete
; c                     delete --- I also have this on "C" because it puts it directly under my left hand. Very quick.
; ctrl r                speed/duration panel
; shift 1               toggle track targeting for AUDIO LAYER 1
; shift 2               toggle track targeting for AUDIO LAYER 2. And so on up to 8.
; alt 1                 toggle track targeting for VIDEO LAYER 1
; alt 2                 toggle track targeting for VIDEO LAYER 2. And so on up to 8. I wish there were DEDICATED shortcuts to enable and disable ALL layers
; ctrl p                toggle "selection follows playhead" (for human to use)
; ctrl alt shift 3      Application > Window > Timeline (default is shift 3)
; ctrl alt shift 1      Application > Window > Project  (This sets the focus onto a BIN.) (default is SHIFT 1)
; ctrl alt shift 4      Application > Window > program monitor (Default is SHIFT 4)
; ctrl alt shift 5      Application > Window > Effect Controls (Default is SHIFT 5)
; ctrl alt shift 7      Application > Window > Effects   (NOT the Effect Controls panel) (Default is SHIFT 7) --- The defaults are stupid. SHIFT 7 is an ampersand if you happen to be in a text box somewhere...
; F2                    gain
; F3                    audio channels --- To be pressed manually by the user. (this might change in the future.)
; ctrl alt shift a      audio channels --- (I will NOT change this, so that it can always be reliably triggered using AutoHotKey.)
; shift F               From source monitor, match frame.
; ctrl /                Overwrite (the default is "." (period))
; ctrl b                select find box - This is such a useful function when you pair it the the effects panel!!
; ---ctrl alt F         select find box â€”OBSOLETE ---
; ctrl shift 6			Apply source assignment preset 1 (set to V5 and A3)
; ctrl ; (semicolon)	Add Marker
; ctrl alt k			Remove selected marker
; ctrl shift alt 9 		activate lumetri scopes
; ctrl alt D   			"deselect all" (clips on the timeline)
; ctrl alt shift K 	 	"shuttle stop"
; CTRL SEMICOLON 		"(add) marker."
; ctrl shift alt R		is "reset to saved layout" (workspace)
; Media_Stop::^numpad7  select label group
; ctrl alt P            pin to clip
; ^!+j 					lock/unlock all audio tracks
